MovieMetrics is my movies database portfolio project.

#**Project Overview**:

In this project, I have utilized MySQL to query and analyze a comprehensive movie database.   
The database includes tables for movies, theatres, shows, users, and bookings, allowing for in-depth insights into ticket sales, user demographics, and movie performance.   
Through various SQL queries, I explored relationships and trends, facilitating better decision-making for cinema operations.  
Additionally, I have utilized Power BI to create insightful visualizations, making the data easily interpretable and accessible.  

# **Database Overview**:
