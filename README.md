# **moviemetrics-SQL**-

MovieMetrics is my movies database portfolio project. The objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience in using MySQL from the creation of table till the final analysis and dashboard creation.   

# **Project Overview**:

In this project, I have utilized MySQL to query and analyze a comprehensive movie database.   
The database includes tables for movies, theatres, shows, users, and bookings, allowing for in-depth insights into ticket sales, user demographics, and movie performance.   
Through various SQL queries, I explored relationships and trends, facilitating better decision-making for cinema operations.  
Additionally, I have utilized Power BI to create insightful visualizations, making the data easily interpretable and accessible.
